I joined the bootcamp because I want to learn. I aim to invest in myself and improve my skills. I am also interested in creating my own websites, and getting a web developer job.

I was already working as a software engineer previously, but the specific role I was in was more focused on the business (or as they call it, 'functional' side of things). I am a technically inclined person, and I wanted to improve that aspect of mine, so I started studying about web development. I believe a web developer role has the most opportunities among all existing software engineering roles, whether it's frontend or backend. This is the reason why I continue to pivot towards this role.
